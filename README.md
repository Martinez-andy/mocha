# Mocha: Finance Done Better

Welcome to Mocha! An all in one financial tool! Mocha is a web application that helps the user create budgets and track expenses. Mocha is smart enough to tell users when they exceed their budgets and even keeps track of the user's transactions using a MySQL data base. Feel free to use Mocha and get ready to experience finance done better!

## Future work:
While other financial applications make credit card recommendations, they do so because those companies pay them the most, not because it is in the best interest of the user. Companies have lost sight of the fact that all decisions should be fixated on the consumer's experience and not the advertisers'. Thus, to combat this I will be implementing a credit card recommendation page that takes your current budget data and calculates which credit cards will save you the most money. Thus, all credit card recommendations are given because they are in the consumer's best interest, not because some company paid us to do so!

## Frameworks
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Data Base: MySQL
<br>
I chose flask and MySQL because they are light weight frameworks that still manage to give 80% of the functionality of their more intense counterparts. I used vanilla JavaScript instead something like React.js or Angular to get the fundamentals of JavaScript down before attempting to learn frameworks built on JavaScript! Additionally, my project was in no way limited by using vanilla JavaScript, thus it made sense to continue using it for my website.


## Demos/How to get started
I am in the process of making hosting the website so that the general public can use my finanical tool! However, until then feel free to check out the demo below which goes over how to use Mocha along with its funtionality.
